Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

First of all, the tests pass but my streamlit doesn't display anything. In that case, I don't feel that I made a successful pipeline. The first error I encountered was an Assertion Error for my apicalls.py, in which a restaurant name was written wrong in the test and I had to fix it for the test to pass. I also had to troubleshoot an error that raised when the place_ids.csv "didn't exist." I had to adjust the path by moving the cache folder out of solutions and into the main project space. However, I think the real error is that maybe my function wasn't properly caching the csv filesâ€“I couldn't solve this even with the solution code. This fix worked around it but was probably not the best solution. I let CoPilot do a lot of the heavy lifting for me here, but sometimes it was wrong and I had to edit it or better define what I wanted it to do with a comment.
